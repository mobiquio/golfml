## Introduction ##

Please visit the source code repository for golfml document instances.

The primary goal of golfml is to provide a XML based data format. This data format is formalized in an XML Schema.

To illustrate the usefulness and the purpose of the golfml data format, we also provide a few sample stylesheets to transform golfml documents to other useful data format. Please recall that these style sheets are provided as illustrations and are not part of the GolfML standard.


## GolfML To HTML ##

[Several stylesheets](CaseStudy2.md) convert simple GolfML documents into various HTML files.

  * `custom-scorecard.xsl` - Prints a standard scorecard for a golf course, with or without score information for up to four players.
  * `score.xsl` - Prints a scorecard for a round of golf for up to four players.
  * `simple-score.xsl` - Prints a simpler scorecard for each golfer for a round of golf.
  * `static-course.xsl` - Prints a standard scorecard for a golf course.


## GolfML To [Scalable Vector Graphics](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) ##

  * `kml2golfml.xsl` - Prototype stylesheet transforms Google Earth Keyhole Markup Language into Golf Markup Language.
  * `golfml2svg.xsl` - Prototype stylesheet formats the geographic information of either a single hole or a whole golf course to a SVG drawing.

Geographic information was collected by drawing polygons in Google Earth. The KML file generated by Google Earth was incorporated in golfml. The case study "[From Google Earth to a Yardage Book](CaseStudy1.md)" details the operations.

## GolfML To [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) ##

  * `golfml2osm.xsl` - Prototype stylesheet transforms Golf Markup Language into [OpenStreetMap XML](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_XML).
  * `osm2golfml.xsl` - Prototype stylesheet to transform [OpenStreetMap XML that contains golf information](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/Golf_course) into a GolfML document.

[Some conventions](Golfml2OSM.md) have been taken to go smoothly back and forth between the two formats.
